I am sure everyone has come across this before. But what is the purpose of asking sellers "Is It Still Available?" and then NEVER responding to them after that regardless of any answer?

At first I thought it was a Facebook Marketplace issue (maybe with some sort of automatic button). But as I have now tried 4 other selling platforms and I get the EXACT same thing from ALL of them. I am convinced this is done knowingly and purposefully by the buyers, but I cannot understand why? What do they get out of it?

I used to just answer, "Yes, it is still available." (and then no response). Now I answer "Yes, it is still available. Are you interested in it? Shall I hold it for you?" (and then still no response).

I completely now accept that this is a well established predictable phenomenon, but what I cannot understand is why it is such a well established predictable phenomenon? I as a buyer also inquire with some sellers on items I want to purchase "Is It Still Available?", but as soon as they answer, I have follow-up questions in my ultimate goal of purchasing the item. What value of pleasure is taken from simply asking "Is It Still Available?" with no further interaction?

Again, I want to be clear, this seems to exist on EVERY selling platform I have been on and is not limited to Facebook Marketplace nor is it simply caused by people hitting a button.

So An AI was made for all those autobots to have a taste of their own medicine ðŸ˜„
